== Block PUT scheduling ==
If there are many small blocks and many big blocks in the queue, they should
be scheduled so that big ones run in the background while the small ones
pop in and out. This is because big blocks are limited by bandwidth and small
ones by latency.

A fairly simple algorithm here might be to have two logical queues;
one for small items and one for big ones.

It would have the nice benefit that the concurrency can be kept high
for latency critical aspects that are cheap (in terms of memory) to
keep highly concurrent, while limiting extreme concurrencies for big
data that might cause memory to become a bottleneck in trying to
achieve wire speeds.

== GC ==
In order to GC you need access to all crypto keys, or you won't be able to
read the manifests to know what blocks are in use, and you won't know the
encrypted names of the blocks when you want to delete them.

For GC and other things it's sometimes good to know what hash
algorithm is being used even if you don't have access to the manifest.

== GPG ==
Use GPG for data encryption? KeyCzar?
Manifest could contain which crypto wrapper to use for a given block.
That way you don't have to re-upload if you change your mind.

== Amazon MD5 ==
Store MD5 as amazon metadata.
Also double-check when materializing.

Update: this is automatically done when using set_contents_from_*()
with boto. So done.
