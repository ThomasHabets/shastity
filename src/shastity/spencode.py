'''

Very simple string encoding/decoded specifically for the purpose of
including characterstrings (NOT byte strings!) into whitespace
separated content.

Please see doc/string_handling.txt for some thoughts on character
strings vs. byte strings.

The encoding is simply as follows:

At the character string level:

  - All strings are encoded in UTF-8.

At the resulting byte string level:

  - All strings are enclosed in single-quotes (in order to be able to represent
    the empty string).
  - All whitespace and single-quotes are encoded in URL encoding style (%xx).
  - The character '%' itself is encoded.
  - Various additional byte values are encoded using %xx style even if they are
    7 bit, with the intended result of avoiding characters that tend to interacti
    with shells, be problematic to display or cut'n'paste etc.

Decoding is simply a matter of:

  - Remove enclosing ''
  - URL-decode the remaining byte string.
  - Decode the resulting byte string as UTF-8.

Note that we convert from character strings to US ASCII character
strings; any converion to byte strings are beyond the scope of this
module.
