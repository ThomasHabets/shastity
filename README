shastity - hash-based deduplicating secure remote backups

== Status ==

This is in-development software (not even alpha level). Do not
use. Yet.

== Running the unit tests ==

Ensure the 'src' directory is in your python path, such as by:

  export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src

Run all unit tests by:

  python test/test.py

If you want the unit tests to include tests that depend on the S3
backend, set the environment variable:

  SHASTITY_UNITTEST_S3_BUCKET

To the name of the bucket to use for testing.

== Getting started ==

=== Get Amazon AWS account ===

=== Install shastity ===

./setup.py install

=== Set up ~/.shastity ===
cat > ~/.shastity
aws_access_key_id your-access-id-here
aws_secret_access_key your-key-here
crypto-key hejsan
verbosity 2
^D
chmod 600 ~/.shastity

=== Create data & manifest buckets ===
TODO: create buckets with shastity

s3cmd mb s3://manifest-bucket
s3cmd mb s3://data-bucket

=== Persist some data ===
shastity persist  /path/to/stuff \
         s3:manifest-bucket,manifest-name,s3:data-bucket

=== Show manifest ===
shastity list-manifest s3:manifest-bucket

shastity show-manifest s3:manifest-bucket manifest-name

=== Materialize data ===
mkdir shastity-temp
shastity materialize s3:manifest-bucket,manifest-name,s3:data-bucket \
         shastity-temp

find shastity-temp

== Notes ==
* manifests store filenames in utf8. If you use something else (or a
  mix of several) then sucks to be you.
